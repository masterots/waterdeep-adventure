Welcome, Traveler! You have in your hands the foremost and most up-to-date guide to the city &mdash; smiled over by none other than its Open Lord, Lady Laeral Silverhand. This chapbook will serve you well until my semindal work on the subject, Volo's Guide to Waterdeep &mdash; sadly long out of print, but now a tome prized by collectors &mdash; can be updated and printed anew. Ask any broadsheet seller, innkeeper, shopkeeper, tavern owner, or bookseller if they'll soon have copies of the new edition for sale!
