<h4 id="taxes-and-fees">Taxes and Fees</h4>

<p>As established in the first year of the reign of the previous Open Lord, Dagult Neverember, Waterdeep collects a monthly tax from all who live within its official wards. The tax is 1 shard per person above the age of ten years, and is collected door-to-door by patrols of the City Guard on the last day of each month.</p>

<p>Individuals who so desire can pay a single dragon in tax and receive a writ exempting them for twelve months, but the writ must be produced each month when the Guard calls, or a new payment is required. If the Guard knocks at a door and receives no answer, a notice of lien with an estimation of tax is affixed to the door. The debt must be dealt with before the next month ends, with payment to be made to any magister.</p>

<p>Those who have no fixed residence can still be taxed if they are confronted in any building, be it an inn or an outhouse. So if you’re out and around on the last day of the month, you’ll no doubt experience “taxing traffic” as the streets become clogged with people trying to avoid the collectors.</p>

<p>Waterdeep also raises revenue by charging other fees, such as the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1 nib</strong> per day for rental of a stall in the Market</li>
  <li><strong>1 shard</strong> (above and beyond any fines imposed) from anyone convicted by a magister, per conviction</li>
  <li><strong>1 dragon</strong> per conveyance leaving the city, empty or full</li>
  <li><strong>5 dragons</strong> per ship that touches dock in Waterdeep (except for city ships and diplomatic vessels), collected from the captain and covering a stay of up to fourteen days (a ship that leaves the harbor and returns during that time pays the tax upon reentry)</li>
</ul>

<p>In time of trouble, direct taxes can also be imposed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>fire tax</strong> (usually 1 dragon per household), levied whenever a fire destroys a large portion of the city</li>
  <li>A <strong>wall tax</strong> or harbor tax (usually 1 dragon per household) raised to directly pay for needed repairs or expansions</li>
  <li>A <strong>lance tax</strong> raised to provide a payroll for mercenaries hired by the city when required (usually 1 shard per household each tenday until the Lords repeal the tax)</li>
</ul>
