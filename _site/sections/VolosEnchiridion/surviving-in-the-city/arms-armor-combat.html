<p>Individuals accustomed to the rough-and-tumble life in much of the North are often surprised by the fact that Waterdavians go about unarmed and unarmored. Yet Waterdeep doesn’t have any law that forbids carrying weapons or armor. Instead, it has a culture of civility that makes such behavior unnecessary.</p>

<p>Dueling has long been illegal in Waterdeep, as has any sort of act involving assault. Individuals caught brawling by the Watch, will all be arrested and judged regardless of who started the fracas, or why. (The tavern brawls that typically break out under the influence of too much drink will often be overlooked by the Watch, as long as the proprietor doesn’t seek payment for damages and no one is significantly injured.) Sport fighting, such as boxing or wrestling, is legal only if it occurs in a location registered with the city for that purpose. Additionally, any blade more than one foot in length is subject to an extra tax whenever it is sold, which helps to explain why Waterdavians prefer to carry knives and knuckledusters for self-defense.</p>

<p>Businesses and individuals to employ armed guards, but except for nobles or foreign envoys, few people travel about the city with such protection. As such, the sight of armed and armored individuals walking the streets who aren’t in the livery of the city or one of its noble houses inspires caution in most Waterdavians. Folk assume that you wouldn’t bother lugging around such equipment unless you either intend violence or expect that it might soon be visited upon you.</p>
