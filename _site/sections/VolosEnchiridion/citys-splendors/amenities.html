        <h3 id="amenities">Amenities</h3>

<p>You’ll find no city on the Sword Coast or in all the North half as civilized as Waterdeep. It’s not just the law of the land that makes this so, but also the comforts that life here provides. In most other towns and cities, you’ll start with an early-morning stumble on the stairs as you carry your night soil down to deposit it outside. But in Waterdeep, many buildings are connected directly to the sewers. Public facilities for those out and about can be found all around the Market and the Field of Triumph, and near the largest city squares. In places without ready access to sewers or public outhouses, members of the Dungsweepers’ Guild make multiple rounds each day, collecting urine and excrement separately — for use in industry and agriculture, respectively. Take comfort that in Waterdeep, you’ll always find a pot to piss in.</p>

<p>Also notice how clean the streets are kept. This upkeep is due in large part to the hard work of the Dungsweepers’ Guild. Dungsweepers can be seen working their brooms and carts at every hour of the day — and for a few hours after dark — all over the city, removing not just animal dung but other refuse. This service is free to all, paid for by taxes rendered to the city — although an egregious amount of trash left for pickup does result in a separate bill from the guild.</p>

<p>Another amenity soon appreciated by visitors is Waterdeep’s water system. With public fountains and wells all about the city, clean water is plentiful. Many buildings have pumps of their own to draw water from the local supply, and some even possess taps that pour out water with the twist of a knob. This convenience is made possible by the inventiveness of the Gondar, the industry of the Cellarers’ and Plumbers’ Guild, and the magic that Waterdeep inherited from the Illefarni elves.</p>

<p>Waterdeep is also a city of light. <em>Continual flame</em> spells illumniate many signs and streetlamps in the wealthier parts of the city. Elsewhere, the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters keeps the streets lit (excepting the Field Ward and the most dangerous areas of the Dock Ward). Not only that, but hundreds of driftglobes bob about the City of the Dead at night, departing to float over the rest of the city each morning. Such is not typical behavior for driftglobes, I assure you!</p>

<p>Lastly, no city in the world is as literate as Waterdeep. Ohhma’s priests from the Font of Knowledge offer free instruction in reading to all who desire it, and the city has over thirty publishers of broadsheets in addition to chapbook printers and book publishers. Large paper advertisements are plastered onto alley walls, and smaller ones are passed out by those hired by businesses to trumpet their services. Printed menus can be found posted in the windows of most eateries and are handed out to those who dine within. Admittedly, you’ll see less reading material in the Dock Ward and the Field Ward, but this fact is notable only because of its preponderance elsewhere.</p>
