        <h4 id="southern-ward">Southern Ward</h4>

<p>It is called the Southern Ward, not the South Ward. Waterdavians are peculiar about this, and if you insist on referring to it as the South Ward, expect to be corrected or thought a fool. The name derives not merely from its southerly location in the city, but from the southerners who settled in this district as the city grew. Today, the ward still hosts most of the traveling merchants who visit the city, and is made up of many enclaves, blocks, and streets primarily occupied by citizens who trace their ancestry to other realms.</p>

<p>One can indulge in the finest halfling food here, enjoy the best singers of Calishite music, and examine the most stunnign works of dwarven crafting — but the first challenge is finding where these treats are housed. The Southern Ward has long been a district of laborers catering to travelers, so its folk have adopted the architectural custom of building homes and businesses above stables or around inn yards, near to where wagon trains are housed.</p>

<p>Residents of the Southern Ward take pride in their legacy as overland travelers and hardworking folk, so it should be no surprise that the ward’s mascot is the mule. On their competition flags, a pugnacious mule in rampant pose stands on a field of red and white — colors said to represent the blood and tears the people of the Southern Ward have shed during their labors.</p>

<p>Not a landmark as such, but surely a sight that must be seen, is the Moon Sphere. This isn’t a structure but an event that occurs during every full moon, when a glowing, spherical field of blue light appears in the square known as the Dancing Court. Any creatures that enter the sphere find that they can fly about inside it just by willing themselves to do so. For centuries, Waterdavians have used the supernatural events to develop a unique flying style of dance — but amature enthusiasts aren’t welcome, except on certain daylight appearances of the full moon.</p>

<p>Even when the full moon isn’t out, the Dancing Court is worth visiting because of the adjacent festhall, the Jade Dancer. During appearances of the Moon Sphere, people sometimes daringly leep into the field of magic from the balconies of this three-story tavern, dance hall, and inn. But the festhall takes its name from a peculiar dancer within it rather than those in the court outside. The “Jade Dancer” is an eight-foot-tall jade statue of a woman that magically animates and dances for patrons — and on occasion serves as a bouncer. Elminster has informed me that despite its dexterity and seemingly fragile beauty, the Jade Dancer is as puissant as a stone golem. So enjoy the show, but don’t get too rowdy.</p>
