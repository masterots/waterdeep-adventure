<h5 id="infamous-alleys">Infamous Alleys</h5>

<p>Waterdeep has as many alleys as Baldur’s Gate has cats, and each has a name and a story. Here are a few that you might wish to see — or should know to avoid.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ruid’s Stroll.</em></strong> This short avenue from Caravan Court to the Trollwall in the Southern Ward is haunted by the hooded ghost of the mage Ruid, whose touch causes deathly chills to those he meets on foggy nights. All attempts to banish or turn the spirit have failed. Those who brave its unearthly approach and allow Ruid to pass through them learn a secret truth about someone or something in their life — if they survive.</p>

<p><strong><em>Brindul Alley.</em></strong> This is the lair of the Hand that Sings, a magical phantasm of a hand with a mouth in its palm. The hand is said to snatch valuables it fancies — especially magical ones — when it encounters them, and to occasionally attack folk in the darkness, strangling them or tripping them into fatal falls. Most often, though, it takes no notice of those who don’t bother or follow it, eerily singing fragments or old Sword Coast ballads and love songs as it drifts through the night.</p>

<p><strong><em>Manycats Alley.</em></strong> This passage crosses two city blocks and winds through the interior of a third, running between and (for the most part) parallel to Julthoon Street and Traders’ Way in the North Ward. it is, unsurprisingly, home to many cats that feed on scraps from the surrounding buchers’ shops, but it is also known for the many carved stone heads of people and animals that adorn the alley’s buildings. Individuals who have walked the alley alone report that some of the headds whispered cryptic messages to them.</p>

<p><strong><em>Gondwatch Lane.</em></strong> Found at the southern entrance to the House of Inspired Hands in the Sea Ward, this alley serves as the testing ground for inventions considered too dangerous to operate inside the temple. The locals are generally unconcerned about the risks though, and stand watching while food vendors circulate among them.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pharra’s Alley.</em></strong> This alley in the Sea Ward is named after the first leader of the House of Wonder, but is more infamous its Circle of Skulls. This infrequent and unpredictable haunting takes the form of seven floating skulls, which hover in a circle and argue with one another in whispered tones about events in the city. If they are interrupted, their reaction reportedly varies from being helpful to engaging in murderous spell-slinging.</p>

<p><strong><em>Three Daggers Alley.</em></strong> This alley in the Dock Ward suffers from a magical curse that causes three daggers to appear out of thin air and attack passersby. The daggers swoop and fly about, making multiple attempts at murder before vanishing again. This magical effect, the result of a spell cast by a long-dead wizard, has resisted all attempts to dispel it. Some locals boast of how many times they’ve crossed the alley and lived to tell of it, but the appearance of the daggers is entirely a matter of chance, and unpredictable. So take my advice and don’t test Tymora’s favor.</p>

<p>Well, gentle readers, you’ve reached the end of my enchiridion. If you’ve yet to arrive in the city, its splendors await you. If you’re reading this within its walls, please set aside this chapbook to experience the city. You might even see an extraordinarily handsome author hard at work reviewing one of Waterdeep’s drinking establishments. If you do so, I greet you in advance: “Well met! Autographs cost seven nibs.</p>
